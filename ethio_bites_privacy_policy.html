                <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
                <p>Welcome to Ethio Bites ("the App"), a service provided by Ethio Clicks ("we," "us," or "our"). We are committed to protecting the privacy of our users ("you"), which include restaurant owners, their staff, and the customers placing orders. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application.</p>

                <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
                <p>We may collect information about you in a variety of ways. The information we may collect via the App depends on the content and materials you use, and includes:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> When a restaurant owner registers, we collect personal information, such as your first and last name, phone number, and password. You may optionally provide an email address and physical address (street and city).</li>
                    <li><strong>Restaurant Information:</strong> We collect all data you provide about your restaurant, including its name, description, address, contact information, logo, banner images, menus, and food item details (name, price, description, images).</li>
                    <li><strong>Staff Information:</strong> When you add staff members, we collect the information you provide, such as a chef's name and experience, or a server's name, phone number, PIN, and profile image.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Firebase Realtime Database:</strong> We use Firebase to sync order statuses in real-time. This involves transmitting order IDs, customer names, statuses, and order items.</li>
                    <li><strong>Supabase Storage:</strong> We use Supabase for secure cloud storage of all images you upload, including restaurant logos, banners, food images, and staff profile pictures.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
                <p>Having accurate information about you permits us to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience. Specifically, we may use information collected about you via the App to:</p>
